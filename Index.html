Dear Mr.Dayanda,<br>

<p>
 I hope you are doing well. My name is Shrinivash, and I live in Khongjom,Langathel.I am writing to ask<br>
 for approval to organize a community clean-up event at BT-Park on Saturday, March 15, 2025.</p>
<p>
This event aims to bring people together to clean the park and make it a nicer place for everyone to<br> 
enjoy.I kindly request access to the park on this date and support with waste collection and supplies<br>
 like trash bags and gloves.</p>
<p>
Please let me know if there are any steps I need to take or forms I need to complete. You can reach<br>
 me at 8787392717 or puyamshrinivash19@gmail.com.</p>

<b>Yours sincerely,</b><br>
